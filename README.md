*A collection of somewhat usable Python scripts for automating various data collection tasks in mostly polymer materials research or made just for fun.*

## Lab Stuff

**asc2png** - Converts text files with data measured with Wide Angle Xray Spectroscopy (WAXS) into graphs comparing the X-Ray source position to the radiation intensity.

**pb_blends** - Analyzes how the properties of polymers measured via WAXS change over time. Multiple plot options.

**waxs2text** - Converts WAXS data in various formats into a unified TXT format for further processing.

**waxsreader** - Utility functions for the other WAXS scripts. Readers of multiple formats for various WAXS machines.

**dsc_eval** - Evaluates melting and crystalization temperatures of polymers measured with Differential Scanning Calorimetry.

**cti2xlsx** - Converts measurements of material transmissivity and emissivity into Excel sheets.

**density_one_year** - Visualises the density of polymers based on their irradiation dose in a graph form.


## Spotify Stuff

**spotify_playlist_to_json** - Converts a Spotify playlist with all available information for each track into a JSON file.

**setlist2json** - Takes the bands from a list and generates a JSON file with their most played songs at shows, according to setlist.fm. The JSON might need some cleanup, for example with foreign characters.

**json2spotify** - Takes the JSON created by previous script and creates Spotify playlists out of it.


## Reddit Stuff

**reddit_thread_activity** - Measures how active a specific reddit thread is over time (how many new comments appear each 'x' seconds).

**subreddit_top_post_users_to_json** - Takes the top posts from a selected subreddit and saves their info and info about their comments into a JSON file for further processing.


## Random Stuff

**clickhash** - Simple CLI tool that hashes and unhashes strings or files.

**sudoku_solver** - Bruteforce Sudoku solver. Initial state can be entered manually. The solution progress is visualised, which can be turned off for increased performance.

**key_distance** - Measures how "long" and "pointy" words are when typed on a keyboard with set dimensions.

**pyxel_pong** - Pong clone utilizing the Pyxel library.

**asyncio_test** - Test script for trying out async downloading.

**make_random_map** - Make a 2D map using and properly arranging sprites matching a randomly generated matrix.

**playfair_cypher** - Implementation for encoding and decoding text using the Playfair cipher.

**sreality_scraper** - Scrapes the Sreality website for house prices and saves the output to a CSV file.

**vscht_book_downloader** - Tool for downloading books in PDF form from the VSCHT website, which only serves one page at a time.
