## A collection of somwhat usable Python scripts for automating various data collection tasks in mostly polymer materials research or made just for fun.

**asc2png**
* Converts text files with a data measured with Wide Angle Xray Spectroscopy (WAXS) into graphs comparing the X-Ray source position to the radiation intensity.

**asyncio_test**
* Test script for trying out async downloading.

**clickhash**
* Simple CLI tool that hashes and unhashes strings or files.

**cti2xlsx**
* Converts measurements for material transmissivity and emissivity to Excel sheets.

**density_one_year**
* Visualises the density of polymers based on their irradiation dose in a graph form.

**dsc_eval**
* Evaluates melting and crystalization temperatures of polymers measured with Differential Scanning Calorimetry.

**key_distance**
* Measures how "long" and "pointy" words are when typed on a keyboard with set dimensions.

**make_random_map**
* Make a 2D map using and properly arranging sprites matching a randomly generated matrix.

**pb_blends**
* Analyzes how the properties of polymers measured via WAXS change over time. Multiple plot options.

**playfair_cypher**
* Implementation for encoding and decoding text using the Playfair cypher.

**pyxel_pong**
* Pong clone utiliting the Pyxel library.

**reddit_thread_activity**
* Measures how active a specific reddit thread is over time (how many new comments appear each 'x' seconds).

**setlist2json**
* Takes the bands from a list and generates a JSON with their most played songs at shows according to setlist.fm

**spotify_playlist_to_json**
* Converts a Spotify playlist with all available infor for each track into a JSON file.

**subreddit_top_post_users_to_json**
* Takes the top posts from a selected subreddit and saves their info and info about their comments into a JSON file for further processing.

**sudoku_solver**
* Bruteforce Sudoku solver. Initial state can be entered manually. The solution progress is visualised, which can be turned off for increased performance.

***vscht_book_downloader**
* Tool for downloading books in PDF form from the VSCHT website, which only servers one page at a time.

**waxs2text**
* Converts WAXS data in various format into a unified TXT format for further processing.

**waxsreader**
* Utility functions for the other WAXS scripts. Readers of multiple formats for various WAXS machines.
